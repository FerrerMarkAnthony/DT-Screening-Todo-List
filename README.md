#Project Overview

This To-Do List Application enables users to manage tasks efficiently. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. The design is responsive, ensuring usability across various devices.​

Features

Add Tasks: Enter a task in the input field and click "Add" or press "Enter" to include it in the list.​

Complete Tasks: Click on a task to toggle its completion status, indicated by a strike-through effect.​

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks by clicking the delete button (❌) next to each task.​

Responsive Design: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.​

Technical Implementation

The application is structured as follows:​

index.html: Contains the main structure of the application.​

styles.css: Holds all styling rules, ensuring a clean separation from HTML.​

script.js: Manages task addition, completion toggling, and deletion functionalities.

Challenges and Solutions

During development, ensuring that tasks could be deleted regardless of their completion status was a challenge. This was addressed by refining the event handling logic to allow task deletion in any state.​

Conclusion

This project provided an opportunity to reinforce fundamental web development skills, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design without relying on external libraries or frameworks.
